# Common zsh configuration goes here.
# Plugin or functionality specific configuration in zsh/configs

# I'm not sure why, but putting this in `zsh/configs/fzf.zsh.local` does not
# work. The file appears to be called, and `[ -f ~/.fzf.zsh ]` appears to return
# true, but the `source ~/.fzf.zsh` doesn't do anything. Leaving it here works
# for whatever reason.
[ -f ~/.fzf.zsh ] && source ~/.fzf.zsh
